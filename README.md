# OnionCat -- An Anonymous VPN-Adapter

OnionCat is a VPN-adapter which allows to connect two or more computers or
networks through VPN-tunnels. It is designed to use the anonymization networks
Tor or I2P as its transport, hence, it provides location-based anonymity and
surveillance protection while still creating tunnel end points with private
unique IP addresses.
